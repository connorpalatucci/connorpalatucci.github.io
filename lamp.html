		 <h1> Lamp â€” Summer 2015 </h1>

		 
		 <p>This summer I tried to do projects related to the apartment I would be moving into for the next year. While visiting my brother in Seattle we ate at a restaurant with beer bottle lamps on the ceiling, and I decided to do a similar project. </p>

		 <h2> The Lamp </h2>
		 <p>
		 Here's the lamp in its new home. It's a reading lamp made of copper pipe that stands about 5 feet tall. The shade is a beer bottle that I cut bottom off. The lamp has three settings, and is operated by touching any part of the metal.

		 <h2> The Shade </h2>
		 <p>
		 Here's a close-up of the lamp shade. It's a 1664 bottle which gives off cool greenish light, and when I bought it I found a bunch of tasty beer inside. This is actually the third bottle that's been on the lamp. Cutting bottles is a tricky process. The first one I cut is an interesting story. I had finished the rest of the lamp, and only needed to cut the bottle. After I cut it, the bottom was sharp and a little jagged so I sanded it smooth for about an hour. Because I was so excited to finish the project, I cut a corner at the end and didn't sand the bottom completely flat. There was one tiny nick in the edge that I assumed nobody would see anyway, so I put the whole lamp together and enjoyed my post-project euphoria. That night, around 2 AM, I woke up to a loud pop. I sat up in bed, and after a few seconds of silence, I heard an even louder crack and the sound of  glass hitting the floor, the bottle had exploded. I think what happened was that the small crack in the bottom was very slowly propagating through the glass and 6 hours later, the fracture grew and shattered the entire bottle. After this I was cursed. The next 20 bottles I cut all ended up breaking. Finally I put a Bass bottle on, but it didn't fit right and I didn't like the look of it or the light it made. It wasn't until three months later that I found a good looking bottle that cut nicely.</p>
		 <p>I cut the bottle using a home-made jig involving a glass scorer. There are plenty of guides online for different types of jigs. They're all pretty simple to make and you can have a fun time cutting decorative bottles into drinking glasses. I have tried the burning string method before and it works, but using a glass cutter is much more likely to produce a clean cut.

		 <h2> The Wiring </h2> 
		 <p>
		 Wiring this lamp up was actually pretty tricky. The wire starts at one of the legs and travels inside the pipe all the way up to the socket. It follows a pretty complicated path through all of the piping so I wouldn't be able to just feed the wire through after soldering everything together. I had to solder the pipe together piece-by piece while feeding the wire through. This caused another problem, because the heat from the torch while soldering the pipe together would wreck the wire inside. I ended up splicing the lamp wire with a sacrificial wire that would be inside the pipe while it was being soldered. After I finished putting the lamp together I said a short prayer while tugging on the sacrificial wire. Thankfully, I was able to feed the entire lamp wire through without wrecking or losing it. After that, the wiring was pretty straightforward. I attached the lamp wire to the touch-switch circuit and connected everything to a power cord from a dead hair dryer. There is an uninsulated copper wire coming out of the electrical box that connects to a screw on the leg of the lamp. This connects the sensor of the touch circuit to the copper pipe of the lamp. </p>

		 <h2> The Body </h2> 
		 <p>
		 Soldering together the body was a pretty fun process that surprisingly went over pretty easily. Learning to solder pipe was a little tricky at first, but it's a useful skill. The entire lamp is made from a 10 foot length of pipe. </p>

		 <h2> Conclusion </h2>
		 <p> 
		 I'm always happy to be able to make things that I can use. The lamp is complete and looks great. People always get a kick out of touching it to turn it on.
