          <h2 id="Intro">Intro</h2>
          <p>This summer I tried to do projects related to the apartment I would be moving into for the next year.
            While visiting my brother in Seattle we ate at a restaurant with beer bottle lamps on the ceiling,
            and I decided to do a similar project.</p>
            <p>Here's the lamp in its new home. It's a reading lamp made of copper pipe that stands about 5 feet
              tall. The shade is a beer bottle that I cut bottom off. The lamp has three settings, and is operated
              by touching any part of the metal.</p>
              <p>I'm always happy to be able to make things that I can use. The lamp is complete and looks great.
                People always get a kick out of touching it to turn it on.
              </p>

              <h2 id="Shade">The Shade</h2>
              <p>Here's a close-up of the lamp shade. It's a 1664 bottle which gives off cool greenish light, and when
                I bought it I found a bunch of tasty beer inside. This is actually the third bottle that's been on the lamp.
                Cutting bottles is a tricky process. The first one I cut is an interesting story. I had finished the rest
                of the lamp, and only needed to cut the bottle. After I cut it, the bottom was sharp and a little jagged
                so I sanded it smooth for about an hour. Because I was so excited to finish the project, I cut a corner
                at the end and didn't sand the bottom completely flat. There was one tiny nick in the edge that I assumed
                nobody would see anyway, so I put the whole lamp together and enjoyed my post-project euphoria. That night,
                around 2 AM, I woke up to a loud pop. I sat up in bed, and after a few seconds of silence, I heard an even louder
                crack and the sound of glass hitting the floor, the bottle had exploded. I think what happened was that the small
                crack in the bottom was very slowly propagating through the glass and 6 hours later, the fracture grew and
                shattered the entire bottle. After this I was cursed. The next 20 bottles I cut all ended up breaking. Finally
                I put a Bass bottle on, but it didn't fit right and I didn't like the look of it or the light it made. It wasn't
                until three months later that I found a good looking bottle that cut nicely.
              </p>
              <p>I cut the bottle using a home-made jig involving a glass scorer.
                There are plenty of guides online for different types of jigs. They're all pretty simple to make and you
                can have a fun time cutting decorative bottles into drinking glasses. I have tried the burning string method before
                and it works, but using a glass cutter is much more likely to produce a clean cut.

              <h2 id="Wiring">The Wiring</h2>
              <p>Wiring this lamp up was actually pretty tricky. The wire starts at one of the legs and travels inside the pipe
                all the way up to the socket. It follows a pretty complicated path through all of the piping so I wouldn't be
                able to just feed the wire through after soldering everything together. I had to solder the pipe together piece-
                by piece while feeding the wire through. This caused another problem, because the heat from the torch while soldering
                the pipe together would wreck the wire inside. I ended up splicing the lamp wire with a sacrificial wire that
                would be inside the pipe while it was being soldered. After I finished putting the lamp together I said a short
                prayer while tugging on the sacrificial wire. Thankfully, I was able to feed the entire lamp wire through without
                wrecking or losing it. After that, the wiring was pretty straightforward. I attached the lamp wire to the touch-switch
                circuit and connected everything to a power cord from a dead hair dryer. There is an uninsulated copper wire coming
                out of the electrical box that connects to a screw on the leg of the lamp. This connects the sensor of the touch circuit
                to the copper pipe of the lamp.

              <h2 id="Body">The Body</h2>
              <p>Soldering together the body was a pretty fun process that surprisingly went over pretty easily.
                Learning to solder pipe was a little tricky at first, but it's a useful skill. The entire lamp is made
                from a 10 foot length of pipe.
