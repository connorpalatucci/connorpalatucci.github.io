		 <h1> Lamp — Summer 2015 </h1>

		 
		 <p>This summer I tried to do projects related to the apartment I would be moving into for the next year. While visiting my brother in Seattle we ate at a restaurant with beer bottle lamps on the ceiling, and I decided to do a similar project. </p>
		 
		 
		 <div class = "text-block">

		 <h2> The Lamp </h2>
		 <p>
		 Here's the lamp in its new home. It's a reading lamp made of copper pipe that stands about 5 feet tall. The shade is a beer bottle that I cut bottom off. The lamp has three settings, and is operated by touching any part of the metal.
		 </p>

		 <h2> The Shade </h2>
		 <p>
		 Here's a close-up of the lamp shade. It's a 1664 bottle which gives off cool greenish light, and when I bought it I found a bunch of tasty beer inside. This is actually the third bottle that's been on the lamp. Cutting bottles is a tricky process. The first one I cut is an interesting story. I had finished the rest of the lamp, and only needed to cut the bottle. After I cut it, the bottom was sharp and a little jagged so I sanded it smooth for about an hour. Because I was so excited to finish the project, I cut a corner at the end and didn't sand the bottom completely flat. There was one tiny nick in the edge that I assumed nobody would see anyway, so I put the whole lamp together and enjoyed my post-project euphoria. That night, around 2 AM, I woke up to a loud pop. I sat up in bed, and after a few seconds of silence, I heard an even louder crack and the sound of  glass hitting the floor, the bottle had exploded. I think what happened was that the small crack in the bottom was very slowly propagating through the glass and 6 hours later, the fracture grew and shattered the entire bottle. After this I was cursed. The next 20 bottles I cut all ended up breaking. Finally I put a Bass bottle on, but it didn't fit right and I didn't like the look of it or the light it made. It wasn't until three months later that I found a good looking bottle that cut nicely.</p>
		 <p>I cut the bottle using a home-made jig involving a glass scorer. There are plenty of guides online for different types of jigs. They're all pretty simple to make and you can have a fun time cutting decorative bottles into drinking glasses. I have tried the burning string method before and it works, but using a glass cutter is much more likely to produce a clean cut.

		 <h2> The Wiring </h2> 
		 <p>
		 Wiring this lamp up was actually pretty tricky. The wire starts at one of the legs and travels inside the pipe all the way up to the socket. It follows a pretty complicated path through all of the piping so I wouldn't be able to just feed the wire through after soldering everything together. I had to solder the pipe together piece-by piece while feeding the wire through. This caused another problem, because the heat from the torch while soldering the pipe together would wreck the wire inside. I ended up splicing the lamp wire with a sacrificial wire that would be inside the pipe while it was being soldered. After I finished putting the lamp together I said a short prayer while tugging on the sacrificial wire. Thankfully, I was able to feed the entire lamp wire through without wrecking or losing it. After that, the wiring was pretty straightforward. I attached the lamp wire to the touch-switch circuit and connected everything to a power cord from a dead hair dryer. There is an uninsulated copper wire coming out of the electrical box that connects to a screw on the leg of the lamp. This connects the sensor of the touch circuit to the copper pipe of the lamp. </p>

		 Soldering together the body was a pretty fun process that surprisingly went over pretty easily. Learning to solder pipe was a little tricky at first, but it's a useful skill. The entire lamp is made from a 10 foot length of pipe. </p>

		 <h1> Laser-Cut Clock — Summer 2014 </h1>
		 
		 <p>This is an ongoing project. By ongoing I mean that it doesn’t work yet. The goal is to make a fully mechanical pendulum clock; here’s how it’s coming along. </p>
		 
		 <h2> The Design </h2>
		 
		 <p>
		 This idea has been a long time coming. I was originally inspired by a clock that I saw in <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGRkxS-aLqg&noredirect=1">this</a> video with an internal gear as the dial. I thought this was such a cool idea that I had to try to make one of my own. My design is a little different from that in the video because the dial pinion in my clock has the minutes printed on it.</p>
		 <p>		 
I’ve been through a lot of iterations of this idea. I originally wanted to power it with a motor and an encoder being timed by an Arduino. Another option would be to use an AC motor that plugs in to the wall and uses the 60 hz of the power grid for timing (this is how the movement is timed in most clocks that you plug in to the wall). I had trouble finding the right motor and encoder to use, and after a while I realized that it would be a lot more fun and interesting to go mechanical with it. 
I designed all of the parts in Solidworks to be laser cut out of Birch plywood. <br>

Here I’ll explain a bit about how the clock works, but if you’re really interested I can’t recommend <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZwq1KL4SD0">this</a> video enough. Old-timey mechanical videos are always so informative (<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4JhruinbWc">here’s</a> one of my favorites explaining how a differential works).
		 </p>
		 
		  
		 <div class = "text-block">
		 <img src = "images/clock/ratchet.png">
		 <div class ="text">
		 <h2> The Ratchet </h2>
		 <p>
		 This is the mechanism that drives the clock. In the photo you can see a cable attached to the back end of this mechanism. This cable will connect to a heavy weight that drives the clock. The weight will turn the drum on the back side of this part, turning the gear on the front. Once the weight reaches the end of its travel the ratchet mechanism will allow the drum to be wound back up without having to turn the clock backwards. The whole mechanism sits on ball bearings. 
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 </div>
		 
		 <div class ="text-block">
		 <img src = "images/clock/gears.jpg">
		 <div class = "text">
		 <h2> The Wheel Train </h2> 

		 <p>
		 One turn of this ratchet equals 1 hour on the dial. I designed a 30 tooth escape wheel for this clock. Because I don’t quite have room for a 3.577 kilometer pendulum (4.3 times the height of the Burj Khalifa) or a 3,600 tooth escape wheel, we’re going to have to slow down the rotation a bit. That’s where the gear train (wheel train for clock people) comes in. </p>
		 <p>		 
		 
		 You can see in the image how the wheel train connects to the ratchet. At the very end of the train will be the pendulum and escape mechanism. Connected to the first set of gears on the top-center arbor will be the dial.
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 </div>
		 
		 <div class ="text-block">
		 <img src = "images/clock/dial.jpg">
		 <div class = "text">
		 <h2> The Dial </h2> 
		 
		 <p>
		This part of the clock may not be terribly interesting mechanically, but it’s the heart of the design. This entire project started because I saw a clock dial that looked like this and I wanted to make one. To ensure the hour dial stays on there will be two minute dials glued together giving it more width to ride on. I’m not sure yet if this will be sufficient to keep the dial from falling off. One cool bonus of this design is that changing time zones is really easy. The hour dial isn’t connected to the clock, it just hangs on top of it so you can just move it to where it needs to go to set the time. If, however, the minute dial is off, you’ll have to unscrew it and re-attach it in the right position. 
		 </p>

		 <div class ="text-block">
		 
		 <img src = "images/clock/pendulum.png">
		 
		 <div class = "text">
		 <h2> The Escape Mechanism </h2> 
		 
		 <p> 
		 This is what I think is the coolest part of the clock. It’s important to remember here that the pendulum isn’t driving the clock, it’s <i>timing</i> it. The pendulum is letting the weight at the other end of the mechanism fall ever-so slightly every time it goes back and forth. Because there’s some friction in any pendulum, if left alone, the pendulum would stop swinging. These are the two functions of the escapement. It allows the wheels to turn a few degrees every time the pendulum passes by, and it gives the pendulum little nudges to keep it going.  </p>
		 <p>		 
		 
		 My particular escapement is called a Graham Deadbeat Escapement. It’s cool for a lot of reasons. If you’re interested in how it works, first you need to <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k30dkRl5au4">see one in action</a>. The Deadbeat Escapement is an improvement on its predecessor, the Anchor Escapement, because it eliminates the problem of recoil. As you can see in the video, each pallet (the little fingers that temporarily hold the escape wheel in place) has a circular face and an angled face. The angled face is called the impulse face. This is where the escape wheel gives the pendulum a little nudge to keep it going. The circular face is called the dead face. Here, the escape wheel is held in place. What’s special about the Deadbeat escapement is the shape of its dead faces. They’re circular arcs centered at the rotation axis of the pendulum. Because there’s a constant radius from the axis of the pendulum to the point where the pallet and escape wheel touch, the wheel train stays perfectly still while being held on a dead face. If the wheel train were being forced back and forth a little bit every time the pendulum passed by (recoil) there would be unnecessary stress on the whole mechanism. That’s the beauty of the Deadbeat Escapement, such a tiny change as adding circular faces to the pallet can have such a huge effect. The invention of this escapement didn’t come from new technology facilitating its manufacture, but just out of one guy’s ingenuity. Old clock makers were the most badass breed of tinkerers.

		 <h2> Right Now </h2>
		 <p> 
		 I hope to get back to it this summer when I have the tools I need to finish assembling it. Right now it looks like there is too much friction in the gear train for it to run properly, but I haven’t tested it yet. If that’s the case I’ll try re-cutting the gears in MDF because the wood I used is warped and the variable radii of the gears caused by the warping makes them difficult to turn. If that doesn’t work I’ll mount all of the arbors on bearings and increase the diameter of the winch. This is just a prototype that I hope to make out of acrylic once it’s working.

         <h1> Topographic Map - Fall 2014 </h1>        
		 
         <p>This project was a gift. I’ve been wanting to build a map like this for a long time; it must have been the first thing I thought of when I learned about laser cutting. I finally had an excuse to spend an unwise amount of time on it in the middle of the semester, so here’s the process. </p>
		 <p>The map is cut out of birch plywood and finished with tung oil. There’s a water based stain on the ocean layer, and all of the type is in Baskerville Old face. The compass was designed by my sister. <a href ="http://palatuccidesign.com/">Plug.</a></p>
		 
		<div class = 'text-block'>
		<h2>The Files</h2>
		<img src = 'images/map/pdf.png'>
		<p> I started with a PDF of the USGS Marion Quadrangle map. </p>
		<img src = 'images/map/ps.png'>
		<p> Then, in Photoshop, I separated every layer on the map and made a 1 px trace of the contour line (in red). All of the hydrography is also a 1 px trace shown in blue. </p>		
		<img src = 'images/map/ai.png'>
		<p> I then used the live trace function in Illustrator to go from a raster image to a vector image. Laser cutters can only cut in vector paths; it wouldn't make sense to try making G-Code out of a regular image. If I were to try sending an image to the laser machine, it would do what's called a raster pass. The head would work its way down the wood going back and forth, turning on the laser wherever it detects a pixel. This is similar to how a regular printer works. What I want, however, is for the laser head to follow the path of the contour lines while continuously cutting. There's a cool analog here to how CRT and CVT displays could work in either raster or vector. The tv could either draw shapes on the screen with its electron beam (vector) or it could go back and forth across the whole screen illuminating individual pixels (raster). The difference between a raster image and a vector image is important to understand if you're trying to do laser cutting.   </p>	
		<p> This is also where I added all of the text. You'll notice that the compass isn't on this file. That was centered on top of the map manually with the laser cutter as its own file because mixing raster and vector is not very pleasant in AutoCad.
		</div>
		
		<div class = 'text-block'>
		<h2>Cutting and Building</h2>
		<img src = 'images/map/mdf.jpg'>
		<p> To get the vector image to a format the laser software can read (.dwg) I had to go from Visio to AutoCad. This was a pain. Once I got cutable files I decided to do a scaled down test in MDF because it's cheap. Good thing I tested it too because there were a lot of problems I had to resolve. Several the lines didn't end up cutting. I never quite figured out what the problem was, but I think it could have been one of two things. One possibility is that there were so many complex lines that the laser cutter couldn't handle it. I had every piece of the map on one sheet because it was scaled down. Another possibility is that the laser cutter was having trouble with the file mixing closed and open contours. It seemed like all of the lines that didn't cut were open contours, and all of the lines that did cut were closed. I have no idea why this would be a problem.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class = "half">
		<img src = 'images/map/sawdust.jpg'>
		<h3>Sawdust.</h3>
		<p>Sand the wood before etching. I hadn't thought of this ahead of time so in between sanding and finishing with tung oil, I had to go through every line with a little brush and a tack cloth to clear out the sawdust.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "half">
		<img src = 'images/map/almost.jpg'>
		<h3>Almost there.</h3>
		<p>Here I was getting a few pieces cut every day. The whole project was getting harder and harder to hide in my dorm room. I was starting to glue the pieces together using binder clips as clamps.</p>
		</div>
		
		<img src = 'images/map/stain.jpg'>
		<p> Staining went very well. I was so worried about how I was going to keep the stain out of the compass because I wanted to preserve the contrast. I spent a few days worrying about it when I finally just did it, and it magically worked out exactly how I wanted. This was very exciting.</p>
		<img src = 'images/map/done.jpg'>
		<p> All done. phew.</p>
		
		<h2> Conclusion</h2>
		<p>This project took quite a long time but it was very rewarding. Most of my time was spent trying to figure out how to go from an image to a file I could laser cut. I had been thinking of this as a barrier for other projects, but now that I can do it I have a lot of new ideas. It took about two months and had a lot of very frustrating periods. It's a good thing that I made it as a gift because if it were for myself I would have given up in the first week. I'm pleased with the result, but there are two errors in the final product that I'll take with me to the grave. <p>

		<h2>The Design</h2>
		<p> This is the cad, I used Solidworks. The outside is just a cube held together with glued finger joints, and on the inside is the motor mount. I've seen laser cut boxes (like the one in the ThinkGeek video) that use a combination of finger joints and bolts, but I don't really like that aesthetic. The advantage of that design is that you can take it apart later if you need to. Because I would only ever need to open up this box to change the batteries, I just left one side unglued (duct tape).</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class = 'text-block'>
		<h2>The Circuit</h2>
		<img src = 'images/box/circuit.png'>
		<p> Here's how it works. The switch on the top of the box is a DPDT switch. When you flip it, it changes the polarity at the leads of the motor. This changes the direction that the motor turns, so when you flip the switch the motor starts turning the arm towards the switch. Once the arm reaches and flips the switch it starts turning in the opposite direction. When the arm is inside of the box it pushes down against a limit switch that turns off the motor. It took a while to find a cheap motor with enough torque to turn the switch, and I'm running it at twice the recommended voltage. I'm not too worried about the health of the motor because it runs for such a short time. I was originally a little concerned about resting current drain from the motor because, in theory, it's cycling on and off between pushing down on the limit switch, turning off and letting the switch back up, and then turning back on to push the switch again. If this is happening, it's negligible; the limit switch is very easy to press. </p>

         <p> For try-outs on McGill Robotics (<a href ="http://mcgillrobotics.com/">plug</a>), the task was to build a robot that plays a game in about 3 weeks. I worked with one other student to build the Flappy-Bot. This is a robot that plays Flappy Bird (kind of). </p>

		<p> I suppose this project should be called the "Pressing-two-on-the-iPhone-calculator-with-a-servo-that's-controlled-by-a-flappy-bird-solver-bot," but that doesn't quite have the same ring to it. In the end we didn't have an android phone to test our app on, but in theory it should work (programmer's famous last words). We needed an android phone because none of us had the license or computer to build iOS apps, even though our game would have ported to iOS fine (ugh). What we wanted was to have a version of the game you could put on your phone that had our solver algorithm built in. You'd then plug the phone into the flappy-bot and every time the solver wanted a tap the phone would send the command to the arduino through USB. What we showed is that we have a working robot that can press a touch screen from commands sent through serial based on a flappy-bird solver. If we had an Android phone I'm confident that it would have worked, but it's hard to predict, more about that later. Anyway, here's how the robot works.</p>

		<p>Here it is all put together. We etched the McGill Robotics and the McGill logo into the sides. Acrylic is great for laser-cutting. This was my first time using it. It etched beautifully and you don't have to worry about the stock being warped like you do with wood. We just did one pass on the laser-cutter and that was it. The joints are just put together with hot-glue. I heard from a friend that you can do acrylic joints using solvent. This sounds cool and I'd be interested to try but we were really pressed for time with this project.</p>

		<p>This was definitely the most interesting problem we ran into during the project because apparently neither of us had any idea how touch screens work. What we thought, and what I think most people think, was that those stylus pens you see with the soft rubber tip are made of a special kind of rubber that can interact with the screen the same way your finger does. As it turns out, the rubber is just there to protect the screen from what's under it, a wire.</p>
		<p>Most phone touch screens use <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitive_sensing">capacitive sensing</a>. I'm not an expert on this, but basically how it works is that there's a grid of capacitive sensors behind the screen. Because your body has electric potential, when a finger comes near the screen the sensors it is closest to are loaded with charge. The phone then senses this charge and locates your finger. We knew almost none of this, which created a very hard problem to get to the bottom of. Thinking that the rubber was the special part, we took apart a stylus pen to attach the rubber tip to our arm. After we took the rubber off I held it in my hand and touched the screen. It worked! Okay, so the rubber must be the special part. So we put it on the acrylic arm to test it out, and it stopped working! hmm. Well look at all of the stuff that was under the rubber tip. There was this little bit of copper wire and a copper coated retaining ring. Those must be there for practical reasons because you can't see them from the outside. Why would they be there otherwise? So we tried again with the whole assembled bottom part of the stylus behind the rubber tip. With that whole assembly in my hand I touched the screen and it worked! Okay, I'm not sure what, but those copper bits must be there for a reason. Let's try it on the arm. Oops, sorry, doesn't work once it's on the arm. At this point we threw everything we knew out. We had to do some research to figure out why it was that the stylus only worked in a hand, and stopped working once we put it on the arm. Then we finally figured it out. A stylus pen works by conducting the voltage from your hand into the metal coating on the outside of the pen. This is connected to a little wire behind the rubber tip. Once the wire comes close to the touch screen it can charge some of the capacitive sensors in the same way that your hand can. This is because it's at the same voltage as your hand. It also acts like your hand in another important way. Your hand has a certain conductivity that needs to be matched by the stylus. If you tried using a steel nail as a stylus the sensors would be charged too quickly and the phone would say "that's not a finger! It may be at the right voltage, but it's way too conductive. Look at how quickly my sensors are being charged. I'd better ignore that." If you tried using something less conductive than your finger the sensors would not be charged at all. The touch screen is calibrated to register a touch when something charges its sensors as quickly as your finger would. It turns out that a small copper wire behind rubber is roughly as conductive as a bag of saline covered in skin (your finger). In the end we added a wire from the stylus tip to the 3V port of the Arduino. This has about the same effect as holding it in your hand. I tried to be very in-depth about this problem here in order to illustrate the exciting and challenging puzzles you get into with these kinds of projects. This sort of problem is what keeps me interested. </p>

		<h2> Flappy Bird Clone </h2>
		<p>This bit wasn't too hard. I could have spent a long time pulling my hair out trying to build a flappy bird clone for the purposes of this project, but there was a deadline. The focus was building the robot not the game, so I cheated and used the tutorial <a href = 'http://www.kilobolt.com/zombie-bird-tutorial-flappy-bird-remake.html'>here</a>. That tutorial from KiloBolt is great. What I found cool about it is that it's built on <a href = 'http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/'>this library</a> that automatically ports the game to all of the popular operating systems automatically. </p>

		<h2> The Solver </h2>
		<p>The algorithm is pretty simple. The bird basically looks at the tower in front of it. If the hole is higher than the bird it asks the Flappy Bot for a jump. Looking back, it would have been cool to incorporate machine learning into the algorithm. I would have had it look at a few towers in front of it and learn the best path. As it is, the algorithm is better than I am at Flappy Bird. I tested it with 100 runs, and a snapshot and histogram of the data is above. The 100 runs had an average score of 17 and a maximum of 89. The bird was guaranteed to make it past the first tower (something I sometimes fail to do) and then it could fail any time after that. The solver would lose for one of two reasons. It could hit the wall on its way down because the solver doesn't look ahead and plan for long falls. It could also fail going up. This issue only arose after we slowed down the rate at which the program could ask for taps based on how quickly the servo could tap. 62% of the losses were going down. </p>

		<h1> Conclusion </h1>
		<p> This was a great project, and I made it onto the team! I really get a kick out of silly and useless technology. This is always a funny one to show people. Unfortunately I tried moving my eclipse workspace and broke everything. Oh well. I was done with the project anyway. It would have been nice to actually build it with an android phone. We've shown that the robot can respond to commands over its serial port, so the first thing we would have tried was using USB. The game would be running the solver in the background and sending commands for taps over serial. If that didn't work we could have tried other things like using the microphone or camera flash on the phone for sending commands. </p>

         <p> This is a programming project that I did in Processing. You can play with it <a href ='tree.html'> here</a>, just click on the canvas and press any key to generate a new tree. I worked on this one on and off for a long time. It was actually one of the first things that I tried making when I first started using Processing, but I wasn't good enough at programming back then to make it work. All of the code is in the webpage if you're interested. It's commented...pretty well. Feel free to dig through it. I also made a pretty cool 3D version, the source for that is <a href="3dtree.txt">here</a> you'll have to run it in processing like the gravity simulator. Processing is great. I'm not really interested enough in programming to take on huge projects but I do really enjoy these little things. Processing is perfect for that.  </p>

         <h1> Gravity Simulator — Fall 2013</h1>  
		<img src = "images/gravity/gravity.png">		 
         <p> Here's a fun little gravity simulator that I also made in processing. You can make different gravitational bodies and see how they interact. If they get too close they'll combine into a more massive glob. The radii of the bodies increase with the cube root of the mass, as if they were spheres. This one was a little tricky and taught me a lot about how Java does math. Unfortunately I tried putting the simulator into javascript and it's just too slow to be any fun. So if you want to play with it you'll have to do it in processing. The source is <a href ="gravity.txt"> here</a>. Just copy that into your processing IDE and it should run. </p>
		 <p>CONTROLS: click and drag to create planets. The longer you click, the more massive the planet will be. Hold DOWN while clicking to make a sun. Press shift to clear the trails. press space to clear the bodies.
